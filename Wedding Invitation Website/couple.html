            <h1 id="backstory-text">Penelope Garcia and Derek Morgan's
                relationship is one of deep friendship and mutual respect,
                marked by playful banter and unwavering support. They met when
                Derek joined the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), where Penelope
                was already working as a technical analyst. Over time, their
                camaraderie grew into a strong bond, with Derek affectionately
                calling Penelope "Baby Girl" and often relying on her tech
                expertise to solve cases. Their deep friendship eventually
                blossomed into love, culminating in an upcoming heartfelt wedding that will
                celebrate their journey from colleagues to lifelong
                partners.</h1>
